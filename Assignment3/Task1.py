#!Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
#~Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
#*1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
#*2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
#*3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
